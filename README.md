## First Back-end Step

- User login
- Integrate database CRUDs with user login account

## User Story

**Home page (User not logged in):** Feed of what's been trending on the platform

**Home page (User logged in):** Feed of people they follow. If none, it displays the feed of what's trending on the platform

**Top right**: Display a create account / login / logout amongst other eventually dropdowns to add to user account functionality

    **Create account**: Ask for user details. User name and password
    **Login**: Prompt to login with user name / password / password reset
    **Logout**: Logs the user out of the system
    
**Top Navigation**: 7 links, looking good on mobile

**Triple sorting of the categories**: A best of the past, a trending, and a "new" ordering will be include for each. They'll be labeled "Hall of Fame", "Greatest of the Latest", and "Brand New".

**Listoka page**: An ordered list of topics created, sorted by newest. Admin account posts for free. User account is charged $1.00 to post a new topic (if possible, otherwise that will not be enabled). User account is charged $.03 to comment.

**Bitcoin Story page**: Three panels on desktop. (Hall of Fame, Greatest of the Latest, Brand New). On mobile, we will display the trending version but give the user the option to change it.

**Stories page**: The three panels on the desktop once again. This will have 7 story categories to start. Each will need their own 3 panels too.
